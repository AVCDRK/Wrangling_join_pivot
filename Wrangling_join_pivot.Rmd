```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)   # contains  masculinity data set we'll use
library(nycflights13) # contains flights data for joining
```

# Data

We're going to use a new dataset, 

```{r}
data("masculinity_survey")
?masculinity_survey
```

This data is from the FiveThirtyEight story, [What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man)

By the end, we will try to reproduce the graphic about how often men try to be the one to pay on a date.

![](img/pay_date.png)

But first, we need to get the data into the right "shape"! Let's review some wrangling tasks. 

First, let's just pull out the rows related to the question about paying on dates. (What function will you need for this?)

```{r}
masculinity_survey %>%
  # fill in some commands here!
```

Now, let's narrow it down just to the variables we will need, which are `response`, `age_18_34`, `age_35_64`, and `age_65_over`. (What function will you need for this?)

```{r}
masculinity_survey %>%
  # your code from above %>%
  # more commands here
```


Finally, let's save this smaller dataset with a new name, `date_q`.

```{r}
# something new 
# old code
```


# New wrangling tasks

There are two **even more** advanced wrangling tasks you may need to do in order to get your data useable for analysis or visualization. They can be characterized as 

- joins: `left_join`, `right_join`, `full_join` and `inner_join` are some of the most common versions, but there are more
- pivots: `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`

## Joins

For the section on joins, we're going to start by playing with small, "toy" datasets. Run this chunk and look at the resulting datasets. 

```{r}
band <- tribble(
   ~name,     ~band,
  "Mick",  "Stones",
  "John", "Beatles",
  "Paul", "Beatles"
)

instrument <- tribble(
    ~name,   ~plays,
   "John", "guitar",
   "Paul",   "bass",
  "Keith", "guitar"
)

instrument2 <- tribble(
    ~artist,   ~plays,
   "John", "guitar",
   "Paul",   "bass",
  "Keith", "guitar"
)
```

A join is useful when you want to combine information from two different datasets, typically to add more variables (although sometimes you're also adding more observations!)

For example, we would use a join if we want a dataset that tells us which band each person is in, as well as the instrument they play. 

The data wrangling with dplyr cheatsheet has some visualizations of how joins work, but it is sometimes easiest just to see it.

Run this code. What is different about the four joins? Which do you think is most useful? 
```{r}
band %>% 
  left_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% 
  right_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% 
  full_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% 
  inner_join(instrument, by = "name")
```


These examples all use `by = "name"` because both datasets have a variable called name. However, as long as the content of the variable can match up, the variable name does not need to. 

```{r}
band %>% 
  left_join(instrument2, by = c("name" = "artist"))
```

### Your turn

Now, we're going to play with some larger datasets from the nyflights package. 

```{r}
data(airlines)
data(flights)
?airlines
?flights
```

We would like to join the `airlines` dataset to the `flights` dataset. Then, we want to compute and order the average arrival delays by airline. Display full names, no codes.

```{r}
flights %>%
  drop_na(arr_delay) %>%
  # write some code here! Use a *_join function
  # more code here. Try some of your wrangling verbs from our refresher
```



## Pivots

Pivots are a different type of data wrangling task. They take just one dataset, and make it either longer or wider. This is typically in the interest of making the dataset "tidy."

A data set is tidy iff:

- Each variable is in its own column
- Each case is in its own row
- Each value is in its own cell

The pivot functions help do this by re-shaping the data

- `pivot_longer` makes data longer, adding more observations
- `pivot_wider` makes data wider, adding more variables

Again, we'll start with toy examples. Run the code below, and think about the variables 

```{r}
cases <- tribble(
  ~Country, ~"2011", ~"2012", ~"2013",
      "FR",    7000,    6900,    7000,
      "DE",    5800,    6000,    6200,
      "US",   15000,   14000,   13000
)

pollution <- tribble(
       ~city,   ~size, ~amount,
  "New York", "large",      23,
  "New York", "small",      14,
    "London", "large",      22,
    "London", "small",      16,
   "Beijing", "large",     121,
   "Beijing", "small",     56
)
```

How many variables are in the `cases` dataset? How many should there be? 
On a sheet of paper, draw what the dataset would look like if it had three variables,  **country**, **year**, **n**. 

This data is longer, so we will use a `pivot_longer` to change its shape.

```{r}
cases %>%
  pivot_longer(-Country, names_to = "year", values_to = "n")
```

Now, let's think about the `pollution` dataset. How many variables does it have? How many should there be? 
On a sheet of paper, draw how this data set would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **city**, **large**, **small**

That data is technically wider, so we will use a `pivot_wider` in order to reshape it.

```{r}
pollution %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = size, values_from = amount)
```



### Your turn 

The last step to get that masculinity survey data into the right right "shape" for visualization is a pivot. Which kind of pivot do you think we want? 

We want the data to have three variables, **response**, **age** and **percent**. See if you can use a `pivot_*` function to get that to happen. 


```{r}
date_q %>%
  # pivot code
```


## Additional wrangling tasks

There are many additional wrangling tasks that might be required to get data into the appropriate format for plotting. One that comes up frequently is related to **factor** variables, R's method of storing categorical data. The package `forcats` can help work with these types of variables. 

```{r}
# Reorder the factor levels
date_q <- date_q %>%
  mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, "No answer", "Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", "Often", "Always"))

# Make age a factor and rename the age groups in the data set
date_q <- date_q %>%
  mutate(age = as_factor(age)) %>%
  mutate(age = fct_recode(age, "18-34" = "age_18_34", "35-64" = "age_35_64", "65 AND UP" = "age_65_over"))
```

Tomorrow, we'll bring this data back to recreate that graphic!
